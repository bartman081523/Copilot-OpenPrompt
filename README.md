# Copilot OpenPrompt Framework

A comprehensive framework integrating GitHub Copilot with advanced reasoning tools and IDE capabilities for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Overview

This repository contains the Augmented-Intellect-Construct framework, a sophisticated meta-prompt system designed to enhance GitHub Copilot's capabilities through structured reasoning, domain-specific tools, and IDE integration. The framework allows developers to solve complex problems through systematic decomposition, analysis, and implementation.

## Key Components

- **Enhanced Meta-Prompt**: The core configuration that defines the reasoning framework and its capabilities
- **AI Editing Toolchain**: Documentation on how the system integrates with code editing workflows
- **Internal Reasoning Model**: Details about the reasoning system's architecture and operation
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques**: Best practices for crafting effective prompts
- **Example Code**: Sample implementations demonstrating the framework in action

## Tools Available

The framework includes specialized tools for:

- **Analysis and Modeling**: Decompose problems, build abstract representations
- **Code Generation**: Create, refactor, and optimize code
- **Testing and Validation**: Verify solutions against requirements
- **IDE Integration**: Seamless workflow with code completion, navigation, and debugging

## Getting Started

1. Review the enhanced-meta-prompt.txt to understand the framework's capabilities
2. Study the documentation files to learn about key concepts
3. Examine the examples to see practical applications
4. Begin by using the framework for small problems, then scale to more complex ones

## Usage Examples

See the `/Example` directory for complete demonstrations of using the framework to solve programming challenges in Haskell, including debugging output and benchmark results.

## Integration Points

This framework is designed to seamlessly integrate with:
- GitHub Copilot
- VS Code and other IDEs
- Your existing development workflow

## Contributing

Contributions to extend the framework's capabilities or documentation are welcome.
