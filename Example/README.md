# Framework Example: Fibonacci Service Implementation

This directory contains a complete example of using the Augmented-Intellect-Construct framework to design, implement, and optimize a Fibonacci service in Haskell.

## Contents

- **fibonacci-service.hs**: The main implementation of the service
- **FibonacciServiceTest.hs**: Test suite for verifying correctness
- **benchmark.hs**: Performance benchmarking code
- **codegen-debug.log**: Log showing the code generation process
- **toolchain-debug-output.log**: Detailed output from the framework's reasoning process

## Problem Statement

The example demonstrates solving the following problem:

> Create a high-performance Fibonacci service in Haskell that can efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers with support for memoization and handling large values.

## Framework Application

This example showcases the application of the following framework tools:

1. **analyze**: Breaking down the Fibonacci problem into components (recursive definition, performance considerations, large number handling)
2. **model**: Creating an abstract representation of the service
3. **code_complete**: Generating the initial implementation
4. **optimize**: Improving performance through memoization
5. **test**: Creating test cases to verify correctness
6. **refactor**: Improving code structure
7. **debug**: Resolving identified issues
8. **document**: Adding comprehensive documentation

## Key Takeaways

This example demonstrates several important aspects of the framework:

1. How formal reasoning guides implementation decisions
2. The interplay between theoretical understanding and practical code
3. Performance optimization techniques driven by framework analysis
4. Test case generation based on edge cases identified by the framework

## Running the Example

To run this example:

```bash
# Run the service
runhaskell fibonacci-service.hs

# Run tests
runhaskell FibonacciServiceTest.hs

# Run benchmarks
runhaskell benchmark.hs
```

## Extending This Example

Try modifying the prompts in the debug logs to:
- Implement alternative Fibonacci algorithms
- Add new service features
- Optimize for different performance characteristics

This will help you better understand how to leverage the framework for your own projects.
